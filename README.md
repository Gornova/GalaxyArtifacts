## Introduction

Galaxy Artifacts is an opensource and freeware [4x game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X]), written in Java.

## Status

* Sprint 1 completed, see [retrospective](https://github.com/Gornova/GalaxyArtifacts/wiki/sprint-1)

## Vision

Galaxy Artifacts is a single player, turn-based desktop game.
Game's focus is on player actions, with no micro management but macro decisions:
* where and when explore?
* what kind of planet colonize?
* what kind of research do ?
* when enter in war with enemies?

It's a one-man game, so be patient! 


## Method

Galaxy Artifacts will be developed in "sprints" with following rules:
* only 4 item for sprint
* always something working in the end of sprint
* design, plan and execute a sprint, never re-design something into a sprint
* code review after each sprint
* put all the code on github and make a tag 
* retrospection and design next sprint
